# Dementia 
Each patient or patient groups will have a different trajectories in terms of degeneration and requires customized healthcare interventions 
In this project I looked into the following things
1. Predict health trajectory, e.g. 6 months, 9 months 
2. Customize living condition/ medicine/care-giving approaches to slow down cognitive degeneration or  complement the cognitive losses in the patient
