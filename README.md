# Dementia 
Each patient or patient groups will have a different trajectories in terms of degeneration and requires customized healthcare interventions 
In this project I looked into the following things
1. Predict health trajectory, e.g. 6 months, 9 months 
2. Customize living condition/ medicine/care-giving approaches to slow down cognitive degeneration or  complement the cognitive losses in the patient

I got access two different datasets related to Alzheimer
1. Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
2. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (https://www.alz.washington.edu/)
