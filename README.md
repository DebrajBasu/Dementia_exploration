# Dementia 
Each patient or patient groups will have a different trajectories in terms of degeneration and requires customized healthcare interventions 
In this project I looked into the following things
1. Predict health trajectory, e.g. 6 months, 9 months 
2. Customize living condition/ medicine/care-giving approaches to slow down cognitive degeneration or  complement the cognitive losses in the patient

I got access two different datasets related to Alzheimer
1. Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
   It is a longitudinal multicenter study designed to develop clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarkers for the early detection and tracking AD.       (http://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
2. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (https://www.alz.washington.edu/)
NACC provides a valuable resource for both exploratory and critical Alzheimer's disease research.

This project is more of exploration and visualization.
Some of my initial understanding and motivation are summarized below:
 - Alzheimer's is a type of dementia that causes problems with memory, thinking, and behavior
 - Symptoms usually develop slowly and get worse over time, becoming severe enough to interfere with daily tasks. 
 - Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of dementia cases
 - The NACC data count for AD is approximately 70%.
 - Alzheimer disease (AD) is mainly characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. 
 - There is no precise and reliable biomarkers or any clinical signs and symptoms for early disease diagnosis
 - However, the research community is investing the time and energy to find out precise instances and markers that may have triggered AD.

The AD assessment is not only a cognitive assessment. Dementia is a state of cognitive decline enough to cause functional problems; thus, describing function is a critical component. As with cognition, functional assessment is challenging, particularly in an international, cross-cultural context.
The biomedical perspective is valuable but not comprehensive to understand the early signs and symptoms of AD.
Social and psychological sciences argue that these measures are overly reductionist and fail to capture the complex reality of dementia as experienced by those with the condition and their caregivers.

Dementia 'models' for research
Dementia is predominantly a disease of later life with a pathogenesis that may span decades. Thus, clinical studies may require protracted follow-up to assess outcomes of interest. One could argue that the focus should be on unselected older adults. However, older adults bring inherent 'noise' in terms of comorbidity, frailty, polypharmacy and so on, as well as the problem of attrition due to death for non-dementia causes. Conversely, if we restrict studies to 'healthy' adults, then results have limited external validity.

'Pre-dementia' states and research
•	Between asymptomatic pathological change and overt disease, there may be a period of more subtle cognitive change that is not sufficient to meet diagnostic criteria for the dementia syndrome.
•	The research is challenging because dementia is a multistage, multi-mechanism set of aging brain pathologies that unfolds over many years. 
•	Prevention trials must recruit a large cohort of individuals at high risk for dementia, target that risk with a potent intervention, and then follow the high-risk cohort on protocolized treatment for many years to detect the intervention's effects on biomarker or clinical outcome trajectories.


Primary (upstream) prevention is known to provide more value, over a longer time frame, than secondary (screening and early detection) and tertiary (mitigation once present) prevention.

At this stage, I am exploring the data sets from both ADNI and NACC. 

Since different neuro-psychological and neuro-pathological tests can quantify the cognitive impairment, but only after the first visit, the impact of the social-economic background, level of education, high cognitive merit, employment status and durations,  lifestyle features (smoking, alcohol) can help to build a regression model to look back where all the cognitive impairment have kicked in. 
•	Different backgrounds can have different trajectories.
•	Based on the outcome of the study, we will be able to propose personalized care for AD patients.
•	The overarching research idea is
o	   to cluster AD patients based on all the available features or markers and 
o	   get a multi-dimensional understanding of how the human brain develops and degenerate under different circumstances and 
o	   what kind of intervention can help people live healthy both physically and cognitively.
